# Security and Compliance

## Security at the Core of Splitmo

At Splitmo, security is our top priority. If you have any feedback, comments, or questions regarding our security practices, please don't hesitate to reach out.

## Compliance with PCI-DSS Standards

Splitmo is a PCI Service Provider Level 1 compliant payment provider. Our commitment to security is validated by independent PCI-certified auditors, subject to the most rigorous compliance processes in the industry.

## Secure Connections using HTTPS

To safeguard information transmitted over the Internet, we insist on all interactions with Splitmo—be it through our website, Dashboard, or APIs—occurring exclusively through HTTPS. This precautionary measure protects against man-in-the-middle attacks. Additionally, we employ HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) across all major web browsers, ensuring a secure connection by compelling browsers to interact with Splitmo solely over HTTPS.

## Secure Integration with Splitmo

When accepting payments through Splitmo, you handle sensitive user information like card details and personal data. It's imperative to ensure that your system remains compliant with security standards, and communication between your customers and servers stays secure.

Our platform is meticulously designed with security and seamless integration in mind. We handle complex security operations on your behalf, making it easier for you. However, security is a shared responsibility between Splitmo and your business.

Throughout the integration process, three key security concepts are emphasized:

1. **Encryption:** Defend against malicious attempts to steal or abuse collected data during server and endpoint exchanges.

2. **Authentication:** Restrict access to data and information collection between authorized users and applications.

3. **Tokenization:** Safeguard sensitive information on servers, protecting it from becoming targets for malicious actors.
